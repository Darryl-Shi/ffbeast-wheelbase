# ffbeast-wheelbase

## Description
Repurposing a hoverboard motor to act as a sim racing wheelbase, based on the FFBeast project.

## Why?
Commercially available direct drive wheelbases are expensive and inaccessible, while entry level wheelbases are not as immersive. A hoverboard motor is capable of outputting up to 15Nm of torque, while being easy to obtain, especially if you can purchase a broken hoverboard.
